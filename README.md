# FinSight
Project Overview:
FinSight is a finance dashboard that provides personal finance trends at a glance. It builds on top of personal finance app like Mint and allows more flexibility to customize charts and graphs that tailors to your needs.
This program provides a data pipeline that takes in all transaction data in a csv format, cleans and transforms the data, and displays data in a dashboard for visualization. The goal is to better track transactions and visualize spending trends, which will lead to more informed financial decisions.
